Overview
This project involves conducting Value at Risk (VAR) analysis using historical, Variance-Covariance, and Monte Carlo models on stock prices of HDFC Bank, HUL, and Tata Steel. The analysis includes back testing and calculating expected shortfall to validate model accuracy and assess market risk and portfolio volatility using returns data points.

Requirements
Python 3.x

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scipy

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/var-analysis.git
cd var-analysis
Install the required packages:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Place the stock price data files in the data/ directory.

Run the analysis script:

bash
python scripts/var_analysis.py
Analysis Methods
Historical VAR: Uses historical stock price data to calculate VAR.

Variance-Covariance VAR: Assumes normal distribution of returns and uses the covariance matrix to calculate VAR.

Monte Carlo VAR: Simulates a large number of possible future returns to calculate VAR.

Results
The results of the analysis, including back testing and expected shortfall calculations, are saved in the results/ directory. Visualizations of the VAR analysis are also provided.
